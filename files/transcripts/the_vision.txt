 It's not a matter of whether or not we can. Everybody can, but not everybody will. How to turn nothing into something. How tangible are ideas and imagination? Ideas that become so powerful in your mind and your consciousness, they seem real to you even before they become tangible. Imagination that is so strong that you can actually see it. You can actually see it. If somebody cannot see it when it is not here, then it will never be here. Start looking into the future of what you would like to accomplish, where you would like to go, the person you would like to be. Slide what you want and then act as if you already had it. And that is to believe that what you imagine is possible for you. So the first step is to imagine what's possible, second step, to believe. Now here's the third step. And that is to go to work and make it real. You now go to work and make it a movement. You make it tangible. Make it viable. You breathe life into it. And then you construct it. You have a lot to offer. The fact that you're still here means that your business is not through yet. People don't do what they know in life, but what they do is they operate within the context of the vision they have of themselves. So right to draw and build and play and dance and live as only you can. Make up your own rules. The rules on what is possible and impossible will make by people who would not test the bounds of the possible by going beyond them. You must change what's possible for you. You and only you are the subject that impacts a burning desire in your imagination. You are living and feeling as if your future dreams are a present fact. Will it be easy? No. Will it be challenging? Yes. So you got to prepare yourself. You've got to develop yourself. Well, as you're breathing, you've got to more work to do. There's something else for you to achieve. Yes, what? You're going to make some mistakes. You're going to make a lot of mistakes. So now go and make interesting mistakes. Make amazing mistakes. Make glorious and fantastic mistakes. Break rules. Leave the world more interesting for you being here. Make good art. It is possible to start with nothing and become something.
